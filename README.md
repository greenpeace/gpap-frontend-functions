## Helper functions & CSS

These get published to NPM and from there to places like UNPKG -

Once on the CDN, can be added to webpages directly.

Add the latest version of he helper scripts:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@gp-australia-pacific/gpap-frontend-functions@latest/dist/index.js"></script>
```

Add a specific version of a CSS file:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@gp-australia-pacific/gpap-frontend-functions@1.1.5/dist/gp-donate.css">
```
